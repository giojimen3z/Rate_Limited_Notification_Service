# Rate_Limit_Notification in GO with  Hexagonal Architecture

![technology Go](https://img.shields.io/badge/technology-go-blue.svg)

## Challenge
We have a Notification system that sends out email notifications of various types (status update, daily news, project invitations, etc). We need to protect recipients from getting too many emails, either due to system errors or due to abuse, so letâ€™s limit the number of emails sent to them by implementing a rate-limited version of NotificationService.

The system must reject requests that are over the limit.

Some sample notification types and rate limit rules, e.g.:

Status: not more than 2 per minute for each recipient

News: not more than 1 per day for each recipient

Marketing: not more than 3 per hour for each recipient

Etc. these are just samples, the system might have several rate limit rules!


## Solution

This is a basic Go application created using hexagon architecture  and golang with BDD for testing and bash scripts for best the performance

## First steps



### Go Runtime Version

Specify the Go runtime version tag you desire in your `Dockerfile`. If in doubt, it's completely safe to always use the
latest one given the [Go 1 compatibility guarantees](https://golang.org/doc/go1compat).


### Release Process Support

Set the application module name in the first line of the `go.mod` file with your application's GitHub repository URL.
Avoiding to do so will result in the CI process, and go command failing.

The file should start with:




### Dependency management

This image has native support for Go Modules and requires the use of it as the dependency management tool.
